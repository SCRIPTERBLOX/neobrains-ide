# Neobrains IDE

A neovim config attempting to be as close to a Jetbrains IDE as makes sense.. or at least providing decent integration with stuff you are probably using

## Setup

### Install dependancies

#### Arch

```bash
yay -S neovim-web-devicons-git
```

*I am sure at this moment there are more dependancies but because I am to lazy to figure out how to find that out you will need to tell me (open an issue)*

#### Debian

*Make an issue detailing what you found out to be a dependancy because I dont have a Debian install so I wouldnt know*

#### Fedora

*Make an issue detailing what you found out to be a dependancy because I dont have a Fedora install so I wouldnt know*

### Install a nerd font

Go to https://nerdfonts.com/font-downloads, choose the font you like and install it

### Clone the config

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SCRIPTERBLOX/neobrains-ide ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

You will need to close the editor once before it works because it will first throw an error
